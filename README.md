# Stock market predictions using Bayesian LSTM networks

The main idea behind this repo is to predict stock market up to several weeks in advance using daily trends. It combines differents stock from a one sector into one combined model. This serves as a starting point to train each stock indivudually. End results are far better that predictions from a single stock.
